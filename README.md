# VidOS

VidOS is a minimal kernel written in rust that can play any ffmpeg  
supported video in the [VGA text buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_text_mode).  

It comes with a converter that converts videos to a custom .data format, which the kernel can use.

# Todo:  
* [ ] video support
* [ ] actually writing the OS part of vidOS  

optional:  
* [ ] edge detection  
* [ ] dithering  
* [ ] gpu support for converter
